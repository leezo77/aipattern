    <!-- Chosen Palette: Professional Blue & Neutral Gray -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured into three main, navigable sections: "AI & Low-Code Synergy," "Platform Comparison," and the original "Core Taxonomy." This top-level navigation allows users to directly access the area most relevant to them. The "AI & Low-Code Synergy" section is a new, static content area that sets the stage by explaining the OutSystems value proposition. The "Platform Comparison" is the core of the update, using a card-based layout to compare different platform types (OutSystems, AI Code Assistants, AI Agent Builders) across key concepts like "Patterns & Templates." The "Core Taxonomy" remains but is enhanced with platform-specific context. This structure was chosen to create a clear narrative: start with the high-level AI value, dive into a direct competitive comparison, and then use the detailed taxonomy for deeper understanding. The user flow is flexible, allowing a user to explore from top-to-bottom or jump straight to a specific comparison or definition. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The application primarily uses structured text and layout for comparison, as this is most effective for a qualitative analysis. Report Info: Taxonomy and competitive analysis. Goal: Compare & Inform. Presentation Method: Interactive tabs and card-based layouts. Interaction: Users navigate between the three main sections. Within the "Platform Comparison" section, they can analyze side-by-side cards that detail how each platform type handles a specific development concept. This direct visual juxtaposition is the key interaction. Justification: Card layouts are excellent for presenting distinct packets of information for comparison, avoiding a dense, hard-to-read table. This approach makes the complex differences between platforms easily digestible. Library/Method: Vanilla JavaScript for tabbed navigation. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                                <p class="text-sm text-gray-600"><strong>Method:</strong> Relies entirely on the developer's prompting skill. A dev must describe the desired pattern (e.g., "create a master-detail UI with React") and then manually copy, paste, and integrate the generated code snippet.</p>
                                <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2"><strong>Value:</strong> Highly flexible but lacks governance.
